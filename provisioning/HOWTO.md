Overview
=============================

Both approaches outlined below will retrieve a minimal Ubuntu 14.10 box and provision it utilizing the bootstrap-bce.sh script. The BCE\_PROVISION environment variable serves as a hint to the bootstrap script so that different authors can create different VMs using the same build framework.  

Note that to create a VM for VirtualBox, you'll need a recent version of VirtualBox (in particular the default version on Ubuntu 12.04 is too old - you'll need to install the Ubuntu virtualbox-4.3 package). 

Creating BCE VMs with Packer
=============================

For a Virtualbox VM, run:

    $ BCE_PROVISION=BCE packer build BCE-14.10-amd64.json

This creates a virtual machine in the OVA format that can be imported into Virtualbox on Windows, Mac, or UNIX.

To create an Amazon EC2 AMI, set your Amazon security credentials in 'BCE-14.10-amd64-ec2.json' and then run:

    $ BCE_PROVISION=BCE packer build BCE-14.10-amd64-ec2.json

Note that currently when you start up a VM from the resulting AMI, you'll need to first login as the 'ubuntu' user and set up SSH keys for the 'oski' user, which is the user provisioned by BCE.

Notes/TODO on provisioning
==========================

I'm still having trouble using the guest additions that are already available
from the VirtualBox install.

Note that it should be possible to attach the bundled ISO for guest additions
using something like the following in the JSON "vboxmanage" section:

```json
[
  "storageattach",   "{{.Name}}",
  "--storagectl",    "IDE Controller",
  "--port",          "1",
  "--device",        "0",
  "--type",          "dvddrive",
  "--medium",        "additions"
]
```

For which you should also switch "guest_additions_mode" to "disable."

But for some reason, I get the complaint:

    VBoxManage: error: Invalid UUID or filename "additions"

Strangely, this DOES work if I execute it during provisioning:

    vboxmanage storageattach "BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64" --storagectl "IDE Controller" --port 1 --device 0 --type dvddrive --medium additions

Go figure
